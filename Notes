Computer network is set of diffeerent devices and connection between them .It can be connection between computer or Internet itself.
By Computer network we mean network of different different devices that are capable of connectivity to internet .

TCP/IP  AND OSI Models
Models to describe actually how computers interact to each other.
Wire shark show the packetrs that are sent from your computer and back .

Devices in computer network commmunicates using strictly defined rule and strictly defined protocols .


computer network required when we want to receive and send some data we need to use some application.for ex google chrome appplication.Each aaplication usses one or several protocol .
Protocols are basically standard of communication that allow to talk betweeen different devices .like SMTP(GMAIL),HTTPS(CHROME),FTP,SSH(UBUNTU).


TCP/IP MODEL(TRANSMISION CONTR4OL PROTOTCOL AND INTERENET PROTOTCOL .

MODEL ONLY DESCRIBE HOW DEVICES COMMUNICATE IN A NETWORK .
ON OTHER SIDE SIDE THERE ARE DIFFERENT STANDARD THAT DESCRIBE COMMUNCATION.

TCP/IP HAS 4 DIFFERENT LAYER 
1. APPLICATION(HTTP,FTP,DNS,DHCP)(USED AT THE TOP LEVEL OF THE TCP /IP MODEL)
2.TRANSPORT (TCP belongs to this layer)(IT ESTABLISHGES END TO END  COMMUNICATION ADN RELIABLY DELIVER DATA  BETWEEN TWO DIFFERNET END POINT PROTOCOL USED ARE TCP/IP,
TCP ESTABLISHES END TO END SESSIN BETWEEN TWO DIFFERENT END POINT RELIABLY SEND THE DATA AND IT IS FULLY TRANSPARENT FOR THE APPLICATION LAYER IF DATA IS SEND THERE IS NO NEDED TO HAVE TCP[ SESSION ALIVE )
(UDP DOESNOT ESTABLISH SESSION ON OTHER SIDE IT SIMPLY SENDS DATA FROM ONE END POINT TO ANOTHER THUS IT CANNOT SENDS DATA RELIABLY )
3.INTERNET (IP belongs to this layer )(TO CONNECT DIFFEEENT NETWORK FIND OPTIMAL PATH AND SENDS PACKET FROM ONE NETWORK TO ANOTHER .)(THERE ARE SEVERAL PROTOCOL THAT WORK ON THSES MODEL 
THEY ARE IPV4,IPV6,ICMP)
4.NETWORK ACCESS.(THIS IS IMPORTANT FOR THE TRANSMISSION OF THE DATA OR THE PHYSICAL MEDIA PROTCOL USED IS ETHERNET )(DIFFERENT TECHNOLOGIES ARE USED IN NETWORK ACCESS LAYER LIKE BLUETOOTH WIFI)(THE MAIN
RESPOSIBILITTIES TO SEND DATA OVER THE PHYSICAL MEDIA )(THERE CAN BE DIFFERENT TYPE OF MEDIA )

ALL LAYERS ARE INDEPENDENT .

COMPUTER COMMUNCATE USING DIFFERENT PROTOCOL ON DIFFERNT LAYERS .


OSI MODELS(OPEN SYSTEM INTERCONNECTION)(IT IS BETTER FOR UNDERSTANDING )
IT HAS 7 DIFFERENT LAYER.
1.APPLICATION LAYER (GOOGLE CHROME,WHATSAPP)
2.Presentation :-Resposible for translation,encryption,and data compression for the application layer .
3.Session layer(for session adn establishment and termination)
4.transport layer (for data transmission over network using TCP/UDP)
5 Network layer :(this layer is resposible for selection of best path from source3 to destination and actual routing of the data from source to destination )
6 Data link layer :this layer is resposible for communication with physical layer dealing with some eror that may occur during commucnation between different devices via
some physical media 
these data link layer ahs two subl;ayer 
1.Media AcCESS Control 
2.Logical Link layer .
7 transmission over different physical media .

Protocol Data unit :-PDU's is smallest piece of information that is related to every layer .Tbhus we can say that bits are PDU's for the OSI model .

The 7 layer is divide into two parts 
1.Host layers 
2.media layers 

For data link layers PDU is frame :-for example ethernet frame .
For network layer PDU is packet.Thus when I say packet is the network layer of the OSI model .I can say IPV4 or IPv6 packet .
For Transport layer there can be TCP or UDP segment .Segment is the smallest piece of information on the transport layer of the OSI model .
Finally Data is the PDU that is common for the application (Interaction with the end user HTTP,FTP),presentation(JPEG,UTF-8),session(Establishes and control session L2TP,H.245).
Transmission of data as (ethernet,wifi,bluetooth).


Encapsulation adn Decapsulation.

Data encapsulation in the TCP/IP model 


It is the process of formatting data and this process adds header to the data .
1. DATA
2.SEGMENT HEADER ,DATA
3.PACKET HEADER ,SEGMENT HEADER ,DATA.
4.FRAME HEADER ,PACKET HEADER ,SEGMENT HEADER ,DATA ,FRAME TRAILER .
5. BITS 


On the opposite side we do the decapsulation 
On the physical layer we get the bits then data goes to Data link.
on the data link layer it reads only the data that is added to the data link layer .
Then it goes to network layer  then it reads the data but now without frame header and frame trailer .
Then transport layer reads the segment header 
Afterwards data goes to application.


ETHERNET 

In tcp/ip model in transport layer we are using TCP protocol adn in the network layer we are using IP protocol.

##It is not just single protocol it is a set of different protocol that define communcation between different devices on data link and physical layer like IEEE 802.3 THAT DEFINE 
COMMUNCATION BETWEEN DEVICES IF THE MEDIA IS WIRED 
AND IEEE 802.11 DEFINES COMMUNICATION BETWEEN DEVICES IF MEDIA IS WIRELESS.


Difference between cooper cable fiber and wireless media.

Data link layer is same for all but physical layer could be different for different cases .We can use media as copper ,fiber or wireless.

Copper cable consist of 8 different wires these are combined into 4 pairs 
Also copper cables has connector on two end and the standard for those connector is here it is RJ45
using Fiber cable we can transmit data using actual light .
1 stands for presence of light in the wire and 0 stands for absence of light in the wire .
Uisng single mode we can transmit data at higher rates and at longer distances than multimode.


Fiber are expensive .


wireless media IEEE.802.11 A, AC,N THAT DEFIENS WIRELESS COMMUNICATION.

1.IT can lead to interference leads to unreconizable signal.
2. its distacnes are limited .

upper layer doesnot know about the type of media that is being used .

If specific devices wants to to connect to other devices it must have specific controller such controller are called network interface card(controller). 

Every network interface card has built in hardware address ccalled MAC address.

MAC stands for media access control address

This MAC address is built in every hardware.Every MAC adress must be unique in the world.

In the same network devices must have different MAC address.In order to communicate with different MAC address.

MAC address is data link address.Such hardware addresses are required for correct commmunication via copper cable, fibre or wireless.


Each MAC Address consist of 48 bits or 6 octets .

there are two different sections in every MAC address  OUI (organizationally unique identifier) and NIC(Network Interface Controller specific )


Network Characteristics 
BANDWIDTH

MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF OF BITS THAT COULD BE TRANSMITTED OVER THE LINK IN SPECIFIC AMOUNT OF TIME .

THROUGHPUT

IT IS THE ACTUAL AMOUNT OF DATA TAHT COULD BE TRANSMITTED OVER SPECIFIC LINK OR CONNECTION.
CONSIDER LINK bANDWIDTH IS 100 mbps 


DATA TRANSFER TIME FROM ONE DEVICE TO ANOTHER(ONE WAY DELAY)

1.QUEUING DELAY(WHIEL TRANSFERRING DATA AT ONCE ALL THE DATA CAN'T BE PROCESSED THUS WE PUT IT IN QUEUE LEADING TO QUEUEING DELAY)
2.PROCESSING DELAY(TWO MDIFFERENT COMPUTER WITH MULTIPLE DEVICES BETWEEN THEM LIKE ROUTER )
3.TRANSMISSION DELAY (HOW MUCH TIME TAKE TO TRASMIT actual frame over wireless or wired connection)
4.PROPAGATION DELAY(time to travel single bit of data from one endpoint to other )

LATENCY IS USUALLY APPLIED TO APPLICATION LAYER OF TCP/IP MODEL


Round Trip Time or PING

time required to send data from one device to another and back .

RTT lower than 300 ms is almost unnoticable 

JITTER
It tellls how latency differs overtime for different packets.
Different packets have different delay i.e latency leaads to sending of packet in order 1,2 ,3 and 3,1,2.
If jiter is very high sometimes some packets will be discarded or lost by the receiver .
I fjittter is very large communication is difficult .
if network comdition are stable then jitter is less.


Switches and Data link layer


Network Switch 

it operates on physical or data link layer 
It interconnect different devices using cooper and fiber link layer .
It doesnot work on application ,transport and Network layer.
There are two types of port end user DOS ports and several uplink ports to connectionto switches 

How different computer will communicate with each other via switch .\
Every computer has its own unique MAC address
  Gi0/1:- 0 is number of slots in the switch and 1 is the port .



HOW DOES IT WORK 
1:- Lets say we have a MAC address at Gi0/1 port and Gi0/2 and Gi0/3 are empty in such case frame is send to every where except the port where it is rece3ived from.
Thus the frame is send to all the computer then the computer will compare there MAC address with destination MAC address.
2. Now if Gi0/2 wants to send the data from Gi0/1 then we can place the MAC adress of Gi0/2 then send the data back to Gi0/1.
3 Now it will not send the data to other as it know where is the sources and destination is .


FRAME OF THE ETHERNET defined in th IEEE802.3 address.

Preamble 7bytes(in conjuction with SFD)
Start of Frame Delimiter (used for synchronization of sender and receiver )
Destiantion MAC address(Every frame start with destination MAC address)(6 bytes )
Source MAC address(6 bytes long)
VLAN TAG(4 BYTES)(if present data pay;lod is 42 byte minimum else it is 46 bytes .
TYPE(2 BYTES)WHICH TYPE OF PROTOCOL IS ENCALSULATED NEXT LIKE IPv4 or6
data payload (42 to 1500 bytes)(it has network layer or transport layer header inside )
CRC(FCS)
except preamble every thing is taken using one way hash function ev ery device calculates trailer and if frame is modified receiver after creation of checksum matches to theat 
of the received check sum will see that check sum donot matches it will discard such frame .
total frame length is from 64 bytes to 1522 bytes.


TYPES OF COMMMUNICATION 

UNICAST:When the specific device wants to send data to other single device i.e when i want to talk to other single person I use unicast.It is used by devices like
phone,laptop and soon.
MULTICAST:when the specific device wants to send data to specific group of other devices  
BROADCAST:When single device communicate with other devices .It consist of all 1's in binary format .

types of MAC addresses
1.UNICAST
2.MULTICAST
3.BROADCAST IT IS USED AS DESTINATION MAC address in the frame when some devices wants to send frame to all the devices in the same switched network adn switchesw will forward such frames to all ports


HALF DUPLEX AND FULL DUPLEX
FULL DUPLEX: WHEN TWO DEVICES ARE ABLE TO SEND AND RECEIVE DATA BETWEEN EACH OTHER SIMULTANEOUSLY.
HAL DUPLEX:DATA COULD BE TRANSMITTED ONLY IN ONE DIRECTION AT ANY MOMENT OF TIME 


HALF DUPLEX COLLISION :

COLLISION OCCURS WHEN DATA ON TEH SAME PHYSICAL MEDIAA IS TRANSMITTED BY DIFFERENT DEVICES SIMULATANEOUSLY .

CSMA/CD and CSMA/CA are defined for handling collision.

Collision DOMAIN

HUBS create large collision domain.
CSMA/CD  can detect collision at every computer and hadle it .
Switch work on physical and data link layer of TCP/IP model and it processes frames
Here collision will not effect other parts.



TRY TO AVOID HALF DUPLEX SETTING .


DHCP has source as unique adddresss but the destination is broadcast 



Network Layer subsection:

Switched network disadvantage 

Switch has large table for MAXC adress

1. Switch sends frames with destination broadcast 
leads to broadcast storm .
2.large MAC addresss table 

Switched network is not a good solution for large network.


for very large network like internet then ofcourse other solution should be used .


Interact between different network we use Router 

IP address
It is the logical address that is assigned to the device in the network layer of the TCP/IP model .
If a device want to communicate with other device it must have IP address assigend to it .

MAC address:-Hardware address assigned by the maufacturer ot the network interface card at the data link layer They are represented using hexadecimal character .
Ip address:-It is a logical address assigned to the devices usually bby the DHCP server on network layer of TCP/IP model and Ip adddress is done using Decimal character.

Ip address may change but MAC donot change .

IPv4 and IPv6 


Both are logical address of the device in the network layer 
IPv4 uses decimal( 4 different section) 
IPv6 uses hexadecimal(128 bits)(8 different section)


IPv4 address format 

4 octet and each octet =8 bit.
every octet is represented using decimal number 
lowest decimal number we can see in octet is 0.
largest decimal number is 255.

Total quantity of IPv4 ADDRESS IS AROUND 3 BILLION.
