Devices in computer network commmunicates using strictly defined rule and strictly defined protocols .


computer network required when we want to receive and send some data we need to use some application.for ex google chrome appplication.Each aaplication usses one or several protocol .
Protocols are basically standard of communication that allow to talk betweeen different devices .like SMTP(GMAIL),HTTPS(CHROME),FTP,SSH(UBUNTU).


TCP/IP MODEL(TRANSMISION CONTR4OL PROTOTCOL AND INTERENET PROTOTCOL .

MODEL ONLY DESCRIBE HOW DEVICES COMMUNICATE IN A NETWORK .
ON OTHER SIDE SIDE THERE ARE DIFFERENT STANDARD THAT DESCRIBE COMMUNCATION.

TCP/IP HAS 4 DIFFERENT LAYER 
1. APPLICATION(HTTP,FTP,DNS,DHCP)(USED AT THE TOP LEVEL OF THE TCP /IP MODEL)
2.TRANSPORT (TCP belongs to this layer)(IT ESTABLISHGES END TO END  COMMUNICATION ADN RELIABLY DELIVER DATA  BETWEEN TWO DIFFERNET END POINT PROTOCOL USED ARE TCP/IP,
TCP ESTABLISHES END TO END SESSIN BETWEEN TWO DIFFERENT END POINT RELIABLY SEN THE DATA)
3.INTERNET (IP belongs to this layer )
4.NETWORK ACCESS.
