Computer network is set of diffeerent devices and connection between them .It can be connection between computer or Internet itself.
By Computer network we mean network of different different devices that are capable of connectivity to internet .

TCP/IP  AND OSI Models
Models to describe actually how computers interact to each other.
Wire shark show the packetrs that are sent from your computer and back .

Devices in computer network commmunicates using strictly defined rule and strictly defined protocols .


computer network required when we want to receive and send some data we need to use some application.for ex google chrome appplication.Each aaplication usses one or several protocol .
Protocols are basically standard of communication that allow to talk betweeen different devices .like SMTP(GMAIL),HTTPS(CHROME),FTP,SSH(UBUNTU).


TCP/IP MODEL(TRANSMISION CONTR4OL PROTOTCOL AND INTERENET PROTOTCOL .

MODEL ONLY DESCRIBE HOW DEVICES COMMUNICATE IN A NETWORK .
ON OTHER SIDE SIDE THERE ARE DIFFERENT STANDARD THAT DESCRIBE COMMUNCATION.

TCP/IP HAS 4 DIFFERENT LAYER 
1. APPLICATION(HTTP,FTP,DNS,DHCP)(USED AT THE TOP LEVEL OF THE TCP /IP MODEL)
2.TRANSPORT (TCP belongs to this layer)(IT ESTABLISHGES END TO END  COMMUNICATION ADN RELIABLY DELIVER DATA  BETWEEN TWO DIFFERNET END POINT PROTOCOL USED ARE TCP/IP,
TCP ESTABLISHES END TO END SESSIN BETWEEN TWO DIFFERENT END POINT RELIABLY SEND THE DATA AND IT IS FULLY TRANSPARENT FOR THE APPLICATION LAYER IF DATA IS SEND THERE IS NO NEDED TO HAVE TCP[ SESSION ALIVE )
(UDP DOESNOT ESTABLISH SESSION ON OTHER SIDE IT SIMPLY SENDS DATA FROM ONE END POINT TO ANOTHER THUS IT CANNOT SENDS DATA RELIABLY )
3.INTERNET (IP belongs to this layer )(TO CONNECT DIFFEEENT NETWORK FIND OPTIMAL PATH AND SENDS PACKET FROM ONE NETWORK TO ANOTHER .)(THERE ARE SEVERAL PROTOCOL THAT WORK ON THSES MODEL 
THEY ARE IPV4,IPV6,ICMP)
4.NETWORK ACCESS.(THIS IS IMPORTANT FOR THE TRANSMISSION OF THE DATA OR THE PHYSICAL MEDIA PROTCOL USED IS ETHERNET )(DIFFERENT TECHNOLOGIES ARE USED IN NETWORK ACCESS LAYER LIKE BLUETOOTH WIFI)(THE MAIN
RESPOSIBILITTIES TO SEND DATA OVER THE PHYSICAL MEDIA )(THERE CAN BE DIFFERENT TYPE OF MEDIA )

ALL LAYERS ARE INDEPENDENT .

COMPUTER COMMUNCATE USING DIFFERENT PROTOCOL ON DIFFERNT LAYERS .


OSI MODELS(OPEN SYSTEM INTERCONNECTION)(IT IS BETTER FOR UNDERSTANDING )
IT HAS 7 DIFFERENT LAYER.
1.APPLICATION LAYER (GOOGLE CHROME,WHATSAPP)
2.Presentation :-Resposible for translation,encryption,and data compression for the application layer .
3.Session layer(for session adn establishment and termination)
4.transport layer (for data transmission over network using TCP/UDP)
5 Network layer :(this layer is resposible for selection of best path from source3 to destination and actual routing of the data from source to destination )
6 Data link layer :this layer is resposible for communication with physical layer dealing with some eror that may occur during commucnation between different devices via
some physical media 
these data link layer ahs two subl;ayer 
1.Media AcCESS Control 
2.Logical Link layer .
7 transmission over different physical media .

Protocol Data unit :-PDU's is smallest piece of information that is related to every layer .Tbhus we can say that bits are PDU's for the OSI model .

The 7 layer is divide into two parts 
1.Host layers 
2.media layers 

For data link layers PDU is frame :-for example ethernet frame .
For network layer PDU is packet.Thus when I say packet is the network layer of the OSI model .I can say IPV4 or IPv6 packet .
For Transport layer there can be TCP or UDP segment .Segment is the smallest piece of information on the transport layer of the OSI model .
Finally Data is the PDU that is common for the application (Interaction with the end user HTTP,FTP),presentation(JPEG,UTF-8),session(Establishes and control session L2TP,H.245).
Transmission of data as (ethernet,wifi,bluetooth).


Encapsulation adn Decapsulation.

Data encapsulation in the TCP/IP model 


It is the process of formatting data and this process adds header to the data .
1. DATA
2.SEGMENT HEADER ,DATA
3.PACKET HEADER ,SEGMENT HEADER ,DATA.
4.FRAME HEADER ,PACKET HEADER ,SEGMENT HEADER ,DATA ,FRAME TRAILER .
5. BITS 


On the opposite side we do the decapsulation 
On the physical layer we get the bits then data goes to Data link.
on the data link layer it reads only the data that is added to the data link layer .
Then it goes to network layer  then it reads the data but now without frame header and frame trailer .
Then transport layer reads the segment header 
Afterwards data goes to application.


ETHERNET 

In tcp/ip model in transport layer we are using TCP protocol adn in the network layer we are using IP protocol.

##It is not just single protocol it is a set of different protocol that define communcation between different devices on data link and physical layer like IEEE 802.3 THAT DEFINE 
COMMUNCATION BETWEEN DEVICES IF THE MEDIA IS WIRED 
AND IEEE 802.11 DEFINES COMMUNICATION BETWEEN DEVICES IF MEDIA IS WIRELESS.


Difference between cooper cable fiber and wireless media.

Data link layer is same for all but physical layer could be different for different cases .We can use media as copper ,fiber or wireless.

Copper cable consist of 8 different wires these are combined into 4 pairs 
Also copper cables has connector on two end and the standard for those connector is here it is RJ45
using Fiber cable we can transmit data using actual light .
1 stands for presence of light in the wire and 0 stands for absence of light in the wire .
Uisng single mode we can transmit data at higher rates and at longer distances than multimode.


Fiber are expensive .


wireless media IEEE.802.11 A, AC,N THAT DEFIENS WIRELESS COMMUNICATION.

1.IT can lead to interference leads to unreconizable signal.
2. its distacnes are limited .

upper layer doesnot know about the type of media that is being used .

If specific devices wants to to connect to other devices it must have specific controller such controller are called network interface card(controller). 

Every network interface card has built in hardware address ccalled MAC address.

MAC stands for media access control address
