Computer network is set of diffeerent devices and connection between them .It can be connection between computer or Internet itself.
By Computer network we mean network of different different devices that are capable of connectivity to internet .

TCP/IP  AND OSI Models
Models to describe actually how computers interact to each other.
Wire shark show the packetrs that are sent from your computer and back .

Devices in computer network commmunicates using strictly defined rule and strictly defined protocols .


computer network required when we want to receive and send some data we need to use some application.for ex google chrome appplication.Each aaplication usses one or several protocol .
Protocols are basically standard of communication that allow to talk betweeen different devices .like SMTP(GMAIL),HTTPS(CHROME),FTP,SSH(UBUNTU).


TCP/IP MODEL(TRANSMISION CONTR4OL PROTOTCOL AND INTERENET PROTOTCOL .

MODEL ONLY DESCRIBE HOW DEVICES COMMUNICATE IN A NETWORK .
ON OTHER SIDE SIDE THERE ARE DIFFERENT STANDARD THAT DESCRIBE COMMUNCATION.

TCP/IP HAS 4 DIFFERENT LAYER 
1. APPLICATION(HTTP,FTP,DNS,DHCP)(USED AT THE TOP LEVEL OF THE TCP /IP MODEL)
2.TRANSPORT (TCP belongs to this layer)(IT ESTABLISHGES END TO END  COMMUNICATION ADN RELIABLY DELIVER DATA  BETWEEN TWO DIFFERNET END POINT PROTOCOL USED ARE TCP/IP,
TCP ESTABLISHES END TO END SESSIN BETWEEN TWO DIFFERENT END POINT RELIABLY SEND THE DATA AND IT IS FULLY TRANSPARENT FOR THE APPLICATION LAYER IF DATA IS SEND THERE IS NO NEDED TO HAVE TCP[ SESSION ALIVE )
(UDP DOESNOT ESTABLISH SESSION ON OTHER SIDE IT SIMPLY SENDS DATA FROM ONE END POINT TO ANOTHER THUS IT CANNOT SENDS DATA RELIABLY )
3.INTERNET (IP belongs to this layer )(TO CONNECT DIFFEEENT NETWORK FIND OPTIMAL PATH AND SENDS PACKET FROM ONE NETWORK TO ANOTHER .)(THERE ARE SEVERAL PROTOCOL THAT WORK ON THSES MODEL 
THEY ARE IPV4,IPV6,ICMP)
4.NETWORK ACCESS.(THIS IS IMPORTANT FOR THE TRANSMISSION OF THE DATA OR THE PHYSICAL MEDIA PROTCOL USED IS ETHERNET )(DIFFERENT TECHNOLOGIES ARE USED IN NETWORK ACCESS LAYER LIKE BLUETOOTH WIFI)(THE MAIN
RESPOSIBILITTIES TO SEND DATA OVER THE PHYSICAL MEDIA )(THERE CAN BE DIFFERENT TYPE OF MEDIA )

ALL LAYERS ARE INDEPENDENT .

COMPUTER COMMUNCATE USING DIFFERENT PROTOCOL ON DIFFERNT LAYERS .


OSI MODELS(OPEN SYSTEM INTERCONNECTION)(IT IS BETTER FOR UNDERSTANDING )
IT HAS 7 DIFFERENT LAYER.
1.APPLICATION LAYER (GOOGLE CHROME,WHATSAPP)
2.Presentation :-Resposible for translation,encryption,and data compression for the application layer .
3.Session layer(for session adn establishment and termination)
4.transport layer (for data transmission over network using TCP/UDP)
5 Network layer :(this layer is resposible for selection of best path from source3 to destination and actual routing of the data from source to destination )
6 Data link layer :this layer is resposible for communication with physical layer dealing with some eror that may occur during commucnation between different devices via
some physical media 
these data link layer ahs two subl;ayer 
1.Media AcCESS Control 
2.Logical Link layer .
7 transmission over different physical media .
