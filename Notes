Computer network is set of diffeerent devices and connection between them .It can be connection between computer or Internet itself.
By Computer network we mean network of different different devices that are capable of connectivity to internet .

TCP/IP  AND OSI Models
Models to describe actually how computers interact to each other.
Wire shark show the packetrs that are sent from your computer and back .

Devices in computer network commmunicates using strictly defined rule and strictly defined protocols .


computer network required when we want to receive and send some data we need to use some application.for ex google chrome appplication.Each aaplication usses one or several protocol .
Protocols are basically standard of communication that allow to talk betweeen different devices .like SMTP(GMAIL),HTTPS(CHROME),FTP,SSH(UBUNTU).


TCP/IP MODEL(TRANSMISION CONTR4OL PROTOTCOL AND INTERENET PROTOTCOL .

MODEL ONLY DESCRIBE HOW DEVICES COMMUNICATE IN A NETWORK .
ON OTHER SIDE SIDE THERE ARE DIFFERENT STANDARD THAT DESCRIBE COMMUNCATION.

TCP/IP HAS 4 DIFFERENT LAYER 
1. APPLICATION(HTTP,FTP,DNS,DHCP)(USED AT THE TOP LEVEL OF THE TCP /IP MODEL)
2.TRANSPORT (TCP belongs to this layer)(IT ESTABLISHGES END TO END  COMMUNICATION ADN RELIABLY DELIVER DATA  BETWEEN TWO DIFFERNET END POINT PROTOCOL USED ARE TCP/IP,
TCP ESTABLISHES END TO END SESSIN BETWEEN TWO DIFFERENT END POINT RELIABLY SEND THE DATA AND IT IS FULLY TRANSPARENT FOR THE APPLICATION LAYER IF DATA IS SEND THERE IS NO NEDED TO HAVE TCP[ SESSION ALIVE )
(UDP DOESNOT ESTABLISH SESSION ON OTHER SIDE IT SIMPLY SENDS DATA FROM ONE END POINT TO ANOTHER THUS IT CANNOT SENDS DATA RELIABLY )
3.INTERNET (IP belongs to this layer )(TO CONNECT DIFFEEENT NETWORK FIND OPTIMAL PATH AND SENDS PACKET FROM ONE NETWORK TO ANOTHER .)(THERE ARE SEVERAL PROTOCOL THAT WORK ON THSES MODEL 
THEY ARE IPV4,IPV6,ICMP)
4.NETWORK ACCESS.(THIS IS IMPORTANT FOR THE TRANSMISSION OF THE DATA OR THE PHYSICAL MEDIA PROTCOL USED IS ETHERNET )(DIFFERENT TECHNOLOGIES ARE USED IN NETWORK ACCESS LAYER LIKE BLUETOOTH WIFI)(THE MAIN
RESPOSIBILITTIES TO SEND DATA OVER THE PHYSICAL MEDIA )(THERE CAN BE DIFFERENT TYPE OF MEDIA )

ALL LAYERS ARE INDEPENDENT .

COMPUTER COMMUNCATE USING DIFFERENT PROTOCOL ON DIFFERNT LAYERS .


OSI MODELS(OPEN SYSTEM INTERCONNECTION)(IT IS BETTER FOR UNDERSTANDING )
IT HAS 7 DIFFERENT LAYER.
1.APPLICATION LAYER (GOOGLE CHROME,WHATSAPP)
2.Presentation :-Resposible for translation,encryption,and data compression for the application layer .
3.Session layer(for session adn establishment and termination)
4.transport layer (for data transmission over network using TCP/UDP)
5 Network layer :(this layer is resposible for selection of best path from source3 to destination and actual routing of the data from source to destination )
6 Data link layer :this layer is resposible for communication with physical layer dealing with some eror that may occur during commucnation between different devices via
some physical media 
these data link layer ahs two subl;ayer 
1.Media AcCESS Control 
2.Logical Link layer .
7 transmission over different physical media .

Protocol Data unit :-PDU's is smallest piece of information that is related to every layer .Tbhus we can say that bits are PDU's for the OSI model .

The 7 layer is divide into two parts 
1.Host layers 
2.media layers 

For data link layers PDU is frame :-for example ethernet frame .
For network layer PDU is packet.Thus when I say packet is the network layer of the OSI model .I can say IPV4 or IPv6 packet .
For Transport layer there can be TCP or UDP segment .Segment is the smallest piece of information on the transport layer of the OSI model .
Finally Data is the PDU that is common for the application (Interaction with the end user HTTP,FTP),presentation(JPEG,UTF-8),session(Establishes and control session L2TP,H.245).
Transmission of data as (ethernet,wifi,bluetooth).


Encapsulation adn Decapsulation.

Data encapsulation in the TCP/IP model 


It is the process of formatting data and this process adds header to the data .
1. DATA
2.SEGMENT HEADER ,DATA
3.PACKET HEADER ,SEGMENT HEADER ,DATA.
4.FRAME HEADER ,PACKET HEADER ,SEGMENT HEADER ,DATA ,FRAME TRAILER .
5. BITS 


On the opposite side we do the decapsulation 
On the physical layer we get the bits then data goes to Data link.
on the data link layer it reads only the data that is added to the data link layer .
Then it goes to network layer  then it reads the data but now without frame header and frame trailer .
Then transport layer reads the segment header 
Afterwards data goes to application.


ETHERNET 

In tcp/ip model in transport layer we are using TCP protocol adn in the network layer we are using IP protocol.

##It is not just single protocol it is a set of different protocol that define communcation between different devices on data link and physical layer like IEEE 802.3 THAT DEFINE 
COMMUNCATION BETWEEN DEVICES IF THE MEDIA IS WIRED 
AND IEEE 802.11 DEFINES COMMUNICATION BETWEEN DEVICES IF MEDIA IS WIRELESS.


Difference between cooper cable fiber and wireless media.

Data link layer is same for all but physical layer could be different for different cases .We can use media as copper ,fiber or wireless.

Copper cable consist of 8 different wires these are combined into 4 pairs 
Also copper cables has connector on two end and the standard for those connector is here it is RJ45
using Fiber cable we can transmit data using actual light .
1 stands for presence of light in the wire and 0 stands for absence of light in the wire .
Uisng single mode we can transmit data at higher rates and at longer distances than multimode.


Fiber are expensive .


wireless media IEEE.802.11 A, AC,N THAT DEFIENS WIRELESS COMMUNICATION.

1.IT can lead to interference leads to unreconizable signal.
2. its distacnes are limited .

upper layer doesnot know about the type of media that is being used .

If specific devices wants to to connect to other devices it must have specific controller such controller are called network interface card(controller). 

Every network interface card has built in hardware address ccalled MAC address.

MAC stands for media access control address

This MAC address is built in every hardware.Every MAC adress must be unique in the world.

In the same network devices must have different MAC address.In order to communicate with different MAC address.

MAC address is data link address.Such hardware addresses are required for correct commmunication via copper cable, fibre or wireless.


Each MAC Address consist of 48 bits or 6 octets .

there are two different sections in every MAC address  OUI (organizationally unique identifier) and NIC(Network Interface Controller specific )


Network Characteristics 
BANDWIDTH

MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF OF BITS THAT COULD BE TRANSMITTED OVER THE LINK IN SPECIFIC AMOUNT OF TIME .

THROUGHPUT

IT IS THE ACTUAL AMOUNT OF DATA TAHT COULD BE TRANSMITTED OVER SPECIFIC LINK OR CONNECTION.
CONSIDER LINK bANDWIDTH IS 100 mbps 


DATA TRANSFER TIME FROM ONE DEVICE TO ANOTHER(ONE WAY DELAY)

1.QUEUING DELAY(WHIEL TRANSFERRING DATA AT ONCE ALL THE DATA CAN'T BE PROCESSED THUS WE PUT IT IN QUEUE LEADING TO QUEUEING DELAY)
2.PROCESSING DELAY(TWO MDIFFERENT COMPUTER WITH MULTIPLE DEVICES BETWEEN THEM LIKE ROUTER )
3.TRANSMISSION DELAY (HOW MUCH TIME TAKE TO TRASMIT actual frame over wireless or wired connection)
4.PROPAGATION DELAY(time to travel single bit of data from one endpoint to other )

LATENCY IS USUALLY APPLIED TO APPLICATION LAYER OF TCP/IP MODEL


Round Trip Time or PING

time required to send data from one device to another and back .

RTT lower than 300 ms is almost unnoticable 

JITTER
It tellls how latency differs overtime for different packets.
Different packets have different delay i.e latency leaads to sending of packet in order 1,2 ,3 and 3,1,2.
If jiter is very high sometimes some packets will be discarded or lost by the receiver .
I fjittter is very large communication is difficult .
if network comdition are stable then jitter is less.


Switches and Data link layer


Network Switch 

it operates on physical or data link layer 
It interconnect different devices using cooper and fiber link layer .
It doesnot work on application ,transport and Network layer.
There are two types of port end user DOS ports and several uplink ports to connectionto switches 

How different computer will communicate with each other via switch .\
Every computer has its own unique MAC address
  Gi0/1:- 0 is number of slots in the switch and 1 is the port .



HOW DOES IT WORK 
1:- Lets say we have a MAC address at Gi0/1 port and Gi0/2 and Gi0/3 are empty in such case frame is send to every where except the port where it is rece3ived from.
Thus the frame is send to all the computer then the computer will compare there MAC address with destination MAC address.
2. Now if Gi0/2 wants to send the data from Gi0/1 then we can place the MAC adress of Gi0/2 then send the data back to Gi0/1.
3 Now it will not send the data to other as it know where is the sources and destination is .


FRAME OF THE ETHERNET defined in th IEEE802.3 address.

Preamble 7bytes(in conjuction with SFD)
Start of Frame Delimiter (used for synchronization of sender and receiver )
Destiantion MAC address(Every frame start with destination MAC address)(6 bytes )
Source MAC address(6 bytes long)
VLAN TAG(4 BYTES)(if present data pay;lod is 42 byte minimum else it is 46 bytes .
TYPE(2 BYTES)WHICH TYPE OF PROTOCOL IS ENCALSULATED NEXT LIKE IPv4 or6
data payload (42 to 1500 bytes)(it has network layer or transport layer header inside )
CRC(FCS)
except preamble every thing is taken using one way hash function ev ery device calculates trailer and if frame is modified receiver after creation of checksum matches to theat 
of the received check sum will see that check sum donot matches it will discard such frame .
total frame length is from 64 bytes to 1522 bytes.


TYPES OF COMMMUNICATION 

UNICAST:When the specific device wants to send data to other single device i.e when i want to talk to other single person I use unicast.It is used by devices like
phone,laptop and soon.
MULTICAST:when the specific device wants to send data to specific group of other devices  
BROADCAST:When single device communicate with other devices .It consist of all 1's in binary format .

types of MAC addresses
1.UNICAST
2.MULTICAST
3.BROADCAST IT IS USED AS DESTINATION MAC address in the frame when some devices wants to send frame to all the devices in the same switched network adn switchesw will forward such frames to all ports


HALF DUPLEX AND FULL DUPLEX
FULL DUPLEX: WHEN TWO DEVICES ARE ABLE TO SEND AND RECEIVE DATA BETWEEN EACH OTHER SIMULTANEOUSLY.
HAL DUPLEX:DATA COULD BE TRANSMITTED ONLY IN ONE DIRECTION AT ANY MOMENT OF TIME 


HALF DUPLEX COLLISION :

COLLISION OCCURS WHEN DATA ON TEH SAME PHYSICAL MEDIAA IS TRANSMITTED BY DIFFERENT DEVICES SIMULATANEOUSLY .

CSMA/CD and CSMA/CA are defined for handling collision.

Collision DOMAIN

HUBS create large collision domain.
CSMA/CD  can detect collision at every computer and hadle it .
Switch work on physical and data link layer of TCP/IP model and it processes frames
Here collision will not effect other parts.



TRY TO AVOID HALF DUPLEX SETTING .


DHCP has source as unique adddresss but the destination is broadcast 



Network Layer subsection:

Switched network disadvantage 

Switch has large table for MAXC adress

1. Switch sends frames with destination broadcast 
leads to broadcast storm .
2.large MAC addresss table 

Switched network is not a good solution for large network.


for very large network like internet then ofcourse other solution should be used .


Interact between different network we use Router 

IP address
It is the logical address that is assigned to the device in the network layer of the TCP/IP model .
If a device want to communicate with other device it must have IP address assigend to it .

MAC address:-Hardware address assigned by the maufacturer ot the network interface card at the data link layer They are represented using hexadecimal character .
Ip address:-It is a logical address assigned to the devices usually bby the DHCP server on network layer of TCP/IP model and Ip adddress is done using Decimal character.

Ip address may change but MAC donot change .

IPv4 and IPv6 


Both are logical address of the device in the network layer 
IPv4 uses decimal( 4 different section) 
IPv6 uses hexadecimal(128 bits)(8 different section)


IPv4 address format 

4 octet and each octet =8 bit.
every octet is represented using decimal number 
lowest decimal number we can see in octet is 0.
largest decimal number is 255.

Total quantity of IPv4 ADDRESS IS AROUND 3 BILLION.

IT is not very large not enough to assign IP adress to all device in the world .
MAC address may be from different manufactures and may not impact communication between devices .
But IP ADDRESS MUST BE FROM THE SAME LOGICAL NETWORK LIKE 172.17.5.1 DEVICE1, 172.17.5.12 DEVICE 2,172.17.5.13 DEVICE 3.



TYPES OF IP ADDRESS

1.UNICAST: ASSIGNED TO SPECIFIC DEVICE IN THE NETWORK FOR ONE TO ONE COMMUNICATION 
2. MULTICAST :SPECFIC DEVICE WANTS TO SEND DATA PACKETS TO MULTIPLE DEVICES 
3.BROADCAST: ALL PALCES 255.255.255.255


Router is network device that is resposible for routing of IP packets on network layer of TCP/IP.ROUTING works on physical ,data link and network layers .
Thus ports of router has ports these have Ip addresses adn MAC addresses.
Router does need information about otehr network where these computer are allocated which is located behind a routere.
For incoming router perform decdapsulation till network layer
for outgoing it perform encapsulation .
Routert find optimal path and route packets 
Its responsibility is to first find optimal path between routing network 
then route actual packets to there destination.

LAN :set of devices and interconnections under  common administration typically located in the same geographical area 
WAN: covers largfe  geographical area and consiost of multiple LANs


IP addreses classes 
A(1.0.0.0 TO 126.255.255.255)(FIRST OCTET(0XXXXXXX)),B(128.0.0.0 TO 191.255.255.255 )(10XXXXXX),C(192.0.0.0 TO 223.255.255.255)(10XXXXXX),D(224.0.0.0 TO 239.255.255.255)(USED FOR MULTICAST FOR VIDEO AUDIO STREAM)(1110XXXX),E(240.0.0.0 TO 254.255.255.255)(RESERVED FOR FUTUTRE USE)(11110XXX)..


LOCAL HOST IP ADDRESS or loop back ip address.


IT IS 127.0.0.1
Using this IP address you could verify whether network stack actually operate on specific device or not .
Also using this IP adress you could connect to any services that are running locally on local host


Difference between private and public Ip addresses

Private Ip addresses are addresese that are not routable in global internet network 


That means routers of internet providers will simply drop any IP packets that is from private Ip adddresses range .


thus if any device wants to connect to to the internet with the private Ip address it will not be able to connect but if the router share the packet with public IP addresses it will be able to connect .


But if a private network has same IP address in other place the two private network can connect with each other .

**So to connect to internet by different devices with private  IP adderess that are non routable in global internet .This is done by NAT (Network address translation)
It helps provide access to the Internet for devices with private IP addresses .



NETWORK 


EVERY SINGLE DEVICE IN INTERNET MUST BELONG AND BELONGS TO SPECIFIC NETWORK .
NETWORK IS A LOGICAL GROUP OF DEVICES AND DEVICES CAN EASILY COMMUNIATE BETWEEN EACH OTHER VIA SWITCHES THEY DONOT REQUIRE ROUTERS.
HOW TO DETERMINE IF DEVICE BELONGS TO THE SAME NETWORK .FOR THAT WE HAVE NETWORK PREFIX AND NETWORK MASK .(10.0.0.0/8) USING THAT WE CAN SPLIT EVERY IP ADDRESSES IN
TWO DIFFERENT PARTS NETWORK PART AND HOST PART.
ALL DEVICES IN THE SAME NETWORK HAS SAME NETWORK PART AND HOST PARTS MAYBE OFCOURSE DIFFERENT ON DIFFERENT DEVICES.
WHERE HOST PART END AND NETWORK PART BEGIN IS DEFINED BY THE NETWORK MASK.
FOR EX (10.0.0.0/8) IS HERE FIRST 8 BITS ARE NETWORK PARTS AND REMAINING 24 PARTS IS HOST PARTS .

IP ADRESSING AND IP PACKETS 
PRIVATE IP ADRESS RANGES
1 CLASSA  network(10.0.0.0 -10.255.255.255)(it is private network )(network is actually 10.0.0.0/8)(LAN)
16 classB networks (172.16.0.0 -172.31.255.255)(it is private network )(network is actually 172.16.0.0/16)
256 classC networks(192.168.0.0-192.168.255.255)(it is private network )(network is actually 192.168.1.0/24) 

PUBLIC IP ADDRESS RANGES 

ADDRESES WHICH ARE NOT ROUTABLE IN GLOBAL INTERENT NETWORK IS PUBLIC IP ADDRESSES 

RIPE IS RESPOSIBLE FOR ASSIGNMENT OF PUBLIC IP ADDRESES 


STATIC AND DYNAMIC IP ADDRESS
WHEN STATIC IP IS ASSIGNED TO THE SERVER WE CAN SAY WE CAN ACESS THE SERVER USING THIS STATIC IP.
STATIC IP ARE ASSIGNED TO PUBLIC SERVER THAT ARE RUNNING SOME PUBLIC SERVICES LIKE WEB OR SMTP SERVICE.
ADVANTAGE OF STATIC IP 
1.IT IS CONVIENIENT FOR WEB OR EMAIL SERVICES.
2.DNS IS USED TO MAP HOST NAME TO IP addresses.

disadvantage 

1.more expensive than dynamic IP
2.Requires additional security .
It is reserved just for one server 

DYNAMIC IP ADDRESES

IP ADRESES ASSIGN DYNAMICALLY TO DIFFERENT DEVICES.THIS ASSIGNMENT HAPPPENS USING SERVER CALLED DHCP SERVER .(DYNAMIC HOST CONFIGURATION PROTOCOL )
THESE CHANGE SPERIODICALLY
1. DYNAMIC ADDRESES ARE CHEAPER THAN STATIC IP 
2.MORE PRIVACY (aS IP ADDRESS CAN CHANGE OVER TIME )
3.DDNS (Dynamic DNS)could be used for automatic inforamtion update after each Ip address change .


disadvantage
1. Ip address may change .
2.we requiree to setup DHCP server to obtain an IP address.



IPv4 packet structure 
there are minimum 5 32 bits section
1.1Version
1.2IHL(internet header length((min lenght 16 bits)(5 vaue means we have 5 32 bits length in packet header).
1.3 DSCP(differentiated services code point)(we can prioritize some packets)
1.4 ECN(explicit congestion motification)
1.5 Total length (total length of IPv4 packets)
2.1 Identification : this identifier allow to gather all fragment of the single intial packets to the origianl packet because there could be different fragment of different packets .
2.2 FLAG ( whether packet was fragmented or not )
2.3 Fragment offset:if packet is divided than each packet has fragment offset number .
3.1 time to live:to prevent infintite loop of packets .when ttl field become zero than router discards such packet and basically every router when it receives specific 
IP packet it decrement TTL field by 1 and send packet to next router .
3.2 Protocol:it is link to upper layer protocol used inside IPv4 packets.
3.3 header check sum(it is calculated only from IPv4 header)(it doesnot include data or payload )
every router receive IPv4 packet need to calculate header check sum when it decremnt ttl .


Source address
Destination address
options 
data payload it can contain TCP/UDP header.




ADRESS IN THE NETWORK 
 
 10.0.0.0/8 HERE NETWOIRK PART IS FIRST 8 BIT AND THE HOST PART IS 24 BITS
 NETWORK ADDRESS 10.0.0.0
 BROADCAST ADDRESS 10.255.255.255
 HOST ADDRESS 10.5.0.41
 
 HOST ADDRESS COULD BE ANY IP ADDRESS BETWEEN NETWORK ADDRESS ADN BROADCAST ADDRESS.
 
 THUS IN ANY NETWROK NETWORK AND BROADCAST ADDDRESS IS FIXED.
 


NETWORK MASK 
CLASS A HAS MASK 8 CLASS B HAS MASK 16 CLASS C HAS MASK 24
EVERY NETWROK HAS 4 OCTETS WITH TWO PARTS AS NETWORK PARTS AND HOST PARTS .
ARE BOTH HOST IN THE SAME NETWORK OR NOT ?
FOR THAT WE NEED TO FIND NETWORK ADDRESS FOR EACH HOST AND THEN COMPARE NETWORK PREFIXES)(ADDRESSES).
NETWORKLL MASK EX 255.255.0.0

CONSIDER NETWORK MASK IS 24 BITS 
192.168.7.10
192.168.7.11
BELONGS TO THE SAME NETWORK 

BUT 192.168.20.12 BELONGS TO THE DIFFERENT NETWORK .

FOR SIMPLE EXAMPLE JUST  DO AND OPERATION BETWEEN HOST IP ADDRESS ADND NETWORK MASK .


HOW MANY HOSTS IN THE SAME NETWORK  ?
130.18.31.0/24
Consider quantity of host bits:8 
network address:130.18.31.0
broadcast address130.18.31.255
available IP address2^8-2=254




SUBNETTING 

IT ALLOWS YOU TO JUST NOT USE THE DEFAULT MASK I.E /8,/16,/24.

IT HELPS TO DECRESE THE QUANTITY OF HOST IN EVERY NETWORK 
OPTIMIZE USAGE OF PUBLIC IPv4

it is a process of creating multiple subnetwork from the same single network .
from the host parts we could create additional subnets 
thus we could split the single network to the multiple network called subnetwork 
This process uses several host bit and ads them to network parts 

it helps to decrese the quantity of host in the network 
using subnetting we increse quantity of the available network but with fewer host in each .


WE can create maximum four subnet when we borrow two bits 


Largest subnet mask is 30 as after that there is no usable Ip address.



ARP AND ICMP 

THESE ARE SUPPPORTINBG PROTOTCOL AND THEY ARE USED AS SUPPORTING DATA .

Default gateway(router)

Router act as gateway to internet for the devices in the network .
Default router is used for connection to other network .
all packets to other network are sent using the router .

default router LAN IP is dame as the IP of various devices in the network .


Now the question is how devices connect with each other in the same network and if they want to send data they need to use router and how these default gateway workl in such case.
